# OGP - Opyn Grant Proposals

Welcome to OGP! Place where we share any cool ideas about Opyn.
We're currently running the grant program to fund developers or community members to help Opyn grow. ([more details here](https://medium.com/opyn/opyn-ecosystem-grants-f4ad0d3b2ae4)) This repo serves as a forum for the community to discuss, brainstorm and collaboratively work on these ideas.
